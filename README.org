#+title: Express Oracle Session Store for Typescript and JavaScript

* Install
#+begin_src sh
npm install express-oracle-session-ts
#+end_src  

* Usage
#+begin_src js
import express from "express";
import eos from "express-oracle-session-ts";
import session from "express-session";

const OracleSessionStore = eos(session);

const sessionStore = new OracleSessionStore({
  user: ORACLE.user,
  password: ORACLE.password,
  connectionString: ORACLE.conStr,
  schema: {
    tableName: "tbl_cloud_session",
  },
});

// Create Express server
const app = express();

app.use(
  session({
    resave: true,
    saveUninitialized: true,
    secret: SESSION_SECRET,
    store: sessionStore,
  })
);
#+end_src

* Notes
+ this module was largely a port of [[https://github.com/Slumber86/express-oracle-session][express-oracle-session]] to typescript
  because at that time express-oracle-session failed to work with node oracle 5.
  But it seems that it has been updated recently probably to address this issue.
+ works with lastest node oracle (5+).
+ will create new table if the current session table doesn't not exist.
+ querying oracle DB, if failed, this module will retry three times. If it can't
  get the connection it will throw an error and exit the app (~process.exit(1)~).
